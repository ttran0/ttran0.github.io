Title: About Me

I am a lecturer for the departments of mathematics and statistics and computer engineering and computer science at California State University, Long Beach.

Aside from teaching, I am a huge data science nerd. When I am not teaching or grading, I am analyzing datasets and learning new tools and methods to further improve my skill set in data science.

My nerdiness in data science is complimented by my love for sports, music, food, and animals. When I am not on the computer or next to a white board, I am chasing and playing with dog, at a concert, or cooking.

I aspire to be a data scientist who helps drive decisions to make a positive social impact. I have been working on a few projects including education and animal welfare data. Please go check out my projects page and let me know what you think. My next project will be the CLEF eRisk 2017 through the CLEF initiative. This project will involve using analytics to detect early depression, suicidal behavior, stalking, and criminal activities using text data from social media accounts.

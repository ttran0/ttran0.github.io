Title: About Me

I am a research analyst at Saddleback College applying my data science background to institutional research to help improve student success.

My nerdiness in data science is complimented by my love for sports, music, food, and animals. When I am not on the computer, I am chasing and playing with my dog, playing video games, having fun at a concert, or cooking.
